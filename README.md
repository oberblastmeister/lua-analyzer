# lua-analyzer

lua-analyzer is a lsp server for lua. This is mostly for me to learn the lsp protocol and language analysis so suggestions are helpful. This server is highly inspired by rust-analyzer and has a lot of code that is similar or copied from it. Currently only the parser is (partially) implemented. Please don't use this yet. We might use salsa for incrementality.
